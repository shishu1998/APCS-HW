Weapon.java - @line25 I think you can make weapons have different colors just like how 
they are dropped to add some effects, but it's only my opinion
Also weapon types do not work

Zombie.java - @line57 I feel charger is way too fast and since zombies can stand on the same 
spot as you it's really hard to kill him, might want to tone him down a bit, but it's also 
just my opinion

GamePanel.java - Should make the gui in the center of the screen and also the size doesn't change
when u maximize

Mask*.java - None of the masks are implemented as of yet
